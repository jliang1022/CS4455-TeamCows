There at instructions at the begininng of the game specifying game
controls. You can use (UP, DOWn ,LEFT, RIGHT) to control the character,
shift to dash/roll, and hold space to throw objects that you pickup.
Objects can be picked up by walking over them when they are still.
Gates are doors that open to other parts of each level. They only open
when you are holding a key. Avoid cows! If you enter their field-of-view,
they will begin to chase you- if they catch up, you lose. Go through the
levels and continue to the next level by reaching the goal.
